Choosing colors looks so tedious, here's a script to help.

This script adds color swatch keybindings to SmoothDraw for Salman Khan.

Keys 0-9 are mapped to the first 10 colors on the color swatch.

## Installation

1. Download [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoHotkeyInstall.exe)

2. Download [this](http://github.com/jb55/khankeys/raw/master/khankeys.ahk) script (Right click, Save As)

3. Open .ahk file

4. Done!

The default bindings are pretty simple to change just by looking at the script.

Cheers!
